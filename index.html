          <p><strong>Why is it important and relevant? Why should we care? </strong>E-commerce has become one of the main go-to sources for clothes shopping these days with the advancement of the digital era. With the world being imposed with restrictions due to conditions like the pandemic, E-commerce has begun to flourish now more than ever. Although online shopping platforms bring retail to the comfort of your home, one of the main challenges that people face while buying clothes is that theyâ€™re not sure how the clothes would look on them once they try them on. In fact, this problem is not only faced by e-commerce customers but also by customers in physical stores. This can happen when they do not have the option of trying on clothes due to pandemic restrictions, for example.</p>
          <p>Therefore, adding this as a feature to e-commerce websites would be very useful for customers as they would be able to make more informed purchase decisions. In addition, physical stores could also have virtual-try on facilities which would even help reduce waiting queues for fitting rooms and possibly assist customers who are in a hurry. This project would therefore help customers have a more satisfying shopping experience overall. Virtual try-on systems with arbitrary human poses have huge application potential but face several challenges such as dealing with varying clothes textures, self-occlusions and misalignment when dealing with different poses and so in our project, we aim to work towards making some contribution and improvement in this direction. </p>

          <h5>Title description, <span class="w3-opacity">April 23, 2016</span></h5>

          <p><strong>Related works that are relevant to our idea.</strong></p>
          <p>With the recently increasing interest in virtual try-on systems bolstered by advancements in the research and applications of GANs, there is a substantial amount of work being done in this field. Xintong Han, Zuxuan Wu et al. worked on an image-based VIrtual Try-On Network (VITON) without using any 3D information. They aimed to transfer a desired clothing item onto the corresponding region of a person using a coarse-to-fine strategy. By conditioning upon a new clothing-agnostic yet descriptive person representation, they first generate a coarse synthesized image with the target clothing item overlaid on the same person in the same pose. They trained the network to learn how much detail to use from the target clothing item, and where to apply it to the person in order to synthesize a photo-realistic image in which the target item deforms naturally with clear visual patterns. With VITON, the authors were able to obtain a higher human evaluation score than state-of-the-art generative models and were able to output more photo-realistic virtual try-on effects. In a study [2] by Bochao Wang, Huabin Zheng, et al., the authors propose a fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network (CP-VTON). The network learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a Geometric Matching Module (GMM). It works to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic by learning a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. The system was able to produce reasonable results with its alignment module while preserving the sharp and intact characteristics of clothes when compared to its baseline VITON model.</p>
          <p>Haoye Dong, Xiaodan Liang, et al. in another study [3], make an attempt towards a Multi-pose Guided Virtual-Try On Network (MG-VTON) in which given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, it can generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes onto the input image. Their system is constructed in three stages: 1) synthesis of target human parse map to match the desired pose and the desired clothes shape 2) warping of desired clothes onto the synthesized human parse map using a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) which helps alleviate the misalignment problem between the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) refinement rendering using multi-pose composition masks which recover the texture details of clothes and remove some artifacts. The MG-VTON was able to generate reasonable results with convincing details outperforming other baseline models such as VITON and CP-VITON. </p>
          <p>Nilesh Pandey and Andres Savakis present Poly-GAN in [4], a GAN architecture conditioned on multiple inputs. In contrast to previous systems which used different architectures in their three staged pipelines for fashion synthesis tasks, Poly-GAN used a common architecture for all three stages. It enforces the conditions at all layers of the encoder and utilizes skip connections from the coarse layers of the encoder to the respective layers of the decoder. The network is able to perform spatial transformations of the garment based on the RGB skeleton of the model at an arbitrary pose. Poly-GAN achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on Structural Similarity Index metric and Inception Score metric using the DeepFashion dataset.
